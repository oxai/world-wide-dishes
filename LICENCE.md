# Terms of use, licensing and maintenance

## Terms of Use
This dataset is primarily intended for evaluating foundation models. However, it can be used for careful fine-tuning, bearing in mind the skewed distribution of regional information provided. We prohibit use of the data in World Wide Dishes in developing prompt templates for the generation of training data or any other related uses. As we demonstrate in this paper, these models have a high propensity for the replication of stereotypical settings and imagery and other undesirable outcomes and errors. Stringent auditing of any generated output is, therefore, necessary to avoid misinformation in the training data.

## Licence
The World Wide Dishes dataset includes text and image data that is free to use under a CC-BY 4.0 licence and is used as such by the authors. In addition to contributor photographs shared with consent, the dataset contains URLs that reference images that (at the time of curation) are under Creative Commons and/or royalty-free licences that allow for their use and distribution. However, we note that the individual images we link to may have licences that do not allow commercial use. Users of this dataset will assume liability if they use the dataset beyond the terms of use as indicated by the benchmark. The authors do not take responsibility for any licences that change with time.

The authors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, they are using all intellectual property in accordance with their licences, and the use of the data as stipulated in this Terms of Use and the accompanying manuscript and GitHub repository does not violate any rights. The GDPR allows for certain processing of personal data for research purposes. Please contact Elizaveta Semenova in the event of concerns: <elizaveta.semenova@cs.ox.ac.uk>.

Please refer to the [World Wide Dishes Github repository](https://github.com/oxai/world-wide-dishes) for the most up-to-date information.  

## Dataset maintenance 

The URLs provided in World Wide Dishes are curated manually. At the time of collection in May 2024, none of the URLs pointed to any images containing harmful or disturbing imagery or depicted children. 
The authors undertake proactively investigate the dataset for broken links, with randomised checks of the images themselves to ensure URLs are not redirecting every 6 months.

We also welcome scrutiny and feedback from members of the community who choose to use the dataset. To facilitate this process, we put forward the following:


- A [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFs2T4zsGXzJdgHKGjkUMsw-sDd97SCV6K09zAXXp6JL0g1A/viewform?usp=sf_link) can be used to identify broken and/or inappropriate links. Authors are notified when a submission is made.
- Feedback, concerns, and issues can be submitted via a GitHub Issue: <https://github.com/oxai/world-wide-dishes/issues>.


## Reporting and/or addressing issues with the dataset
If there are any concerns about the dataset or specific links to images or associated images, please contact the authors by filling out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFs2T4zsGXzJdgHKGjkUMsw-sDd97SCV6K09zAXXp6JL0g1A/viewform?usp=sf_link) and offending information will be removed immediately. Such concerns may include but are not limited to: issues with the metadata related to a dish; deprecated links; links that have redirected to disturbing or inappropriate content; or you may have identified yourself in an image and would like such image removed.
