This is a cold-weather dish from hill tribal regions of Upper Myanmar and northeastern India, and more specifically the Naga people. The Naga are a group of semi-isolated clans indigenous to the Sagaing, Chin, and Kachin states in Myanmar, and are famously known as fierce ""headhunters"" (partly bc of their ornate bone jewelry and body modifications, but largely bc of their actual warfare practices of decapitating enemy warriors during conflicts). Their ethnic self-determination and ferocity against local and foreign (i.e., the British) settlers are precisely why they were quickly granted tribal statehood in post-colonial Myanmar (the Naga Self-Administered Zone) and India (Nagaland). 

The dish itself is extremely common throughout Myanmar, with various adaptations to suit local palates and ingredient availability - for example, the version pictured here was made with fermented mustard greens for the sour leafy component instead of the more traditional Mejenga leaves. The piercing fermented sour/spicy taste profile is mirrored in the ethnic dishes of the neighboring Kachin and Chin people, and resembles the tamarind-based soups of southern South Asia and Southeast Asia (e.g. Sri Lankan Rasam, Minangkabau/Malay Asam Pedas, and Filipino Sinigang). As with most hill-tribe cuisine, the stinkier and spicier, the better - especially when you're washing it down with an equally-potent swing of fermented rice ""beer"" (Zutho).",,,717.jpg,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GSgEC9GaJpsMy0V0oIySVX-v4kBeHkmK/view?usp=sharing,"A Burmese interpretation of the Naga sour pork stew (wet-thar-hmyit-chin) with a mound of white Jasmine rice topped with two slices of Bird's Eye chili peppers, served in a shallow white bowl."

The Mon founded one of the first major kingdoms of Myanmar and Northern Thailand, and are credited for establishing Theravada Buddhism across the region. They were also pre-historic ""river people"" and proliferated wet rice agriculture through the Irrawaddy delta, which eventually allowed Myanmar to become known as the Rice Bowl of Asia - these are proudly highlighted by the rice and saltwater fish in this dish. 

Simple as it is, as a Thingyan meal, the dish stimulates specific senses closely tied to the Myanmar Water Festival experience: the unusual wetness courtesy of our water sprinkling/splashing community customs (to wash away the past year's sins); the sweet and earthy combined fragrance of jasmine rice, sun-dried fish, green mango, and roasted chilis recalls the ubiquitous pre-monsoon aroma of hot rain,  jasmine garlands, and padauk leaves/flowers (padauk seasonally blooms during Thingyan and is Myanmar's national flower); and the smokiness infused into the assembled dish via a covered, lit beeswax candle, which channels the many candles folks would light on Thingyan Eve to welcome Thagyarmin for his annual earthly judgement (TGM is the Burmese ""King of Deities"" with origins in the pre-Buddhist animistic religions of Old Myanmar, analogous to the Vedic Indra or Ancient Greek Zeus).

Thailand has a similar dish (""khao chae"", or ""soaked rice"") that was adapted from Thingyan Htamin. But don't worry, it's fully Mon and the Thais are still salty about our quabbles over Ayutthaya. ;)",,,697.jpg,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fqVwvXrzVepL4Tk6x-F143yjquP_1_1W/view?usp=sharing,"Traditional Thingyan Htamin (သင်္ကြန်ထမင်း, or ""New Year Rice"") from the Mon ethnic group of Myanmar/Burma.

Alternative spellings include ""mohingar"", ""mohingha"", ""mont-hin-gar"" (a transliteration of the Burmese characters). The commonly accepted spelling/pronunciation, ""mohinga"", is a colloquial contraction of the Burmese name,  which roughly translates to ""lightly fermented thin rice noodles (mont) in bitter (kha) broth (hinn)"".

The standard formulation of mohinga comes from the Irrawaddy (or Ayeyarwaddy) Delta, specifically Ayeyarwaddy and Yangon, and is extremely peppery with a lighter broth and more pungent fish. Ethnic and regional adaptations range from the notoriously spicy versions from the Eastern- (Kayin/Karen) and Western-most states (Rakhine), to denser and less fishy versions in the Central, arid regions (Mandalay, Bagan, Mogok) due to the relative lack of wet rice and fish farming. Mohinga is predominantly a ""valley people"" dish from the river lowlands - there are fewer adaptations of mohinga from the northern hill states (Chin, Kachin, Shan), although some convergent varieties exist, such as Kengtung noodles from Shan State.

The toppings for mohinga are also extremely variable, ranging from chickpea and gourd fritters to Chinese youtiao.

Fun facts :)
The bitter leaf plant, known scientifically as Vernonia Amygdalina, is a herb consumed in tropical climates, particularly in West Africa, where it's valued for both its ethnomedicinal properties and culinary uses. It's a key ingredient in local dishes like Cameroon's national dish, Ndolè, and Nigeria's Onugbu soup. The plant is notable for its bitter taste, which is considered a substitute for quinine, and it's often regarded as a universal remedy for numerous ailments.

2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon (12 grams) granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2-3 cups (470-710 milliliters) milk
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) vegetable oil plus more or butter for the pan
For Serving:
Sour cream
Honey or sweetened condensed milk
Jam
Instructions
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.
Slowly whisk in the milk until combined and no lumps remain. Add 2 cups (470 milliliters) milk for slightly thicker and easier to handle pancakes or up to 3 cups (710 milliliters) milk for thinner, more delicate pancakes.
Whisk in the eggs, followed by the vegetable oil. If too thick, slowly add a little more milk. If too thin, slowly add a little more flour.
Cover the bowl and allow to rest at room temperature for 15-30 minutes.
Place a large nonstick skillet or pan over medium low heat. Lightly grease with oil or butter.
Once thoroughly heated, add 1/4 – 1/3 cup (60-80 milliliters) batter to the center and immediately tilt the pan in a circle to coat the bottom in a thin layer.
Cook until set on the top and the bottom turns golden, about 2 minutes.
Flip and cook until the other side is golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove to plate. Rub the pan with more oil and repeat with remaining batter.
Serve immediately with sour cream, jam, honey, and/or sweetened condensed milk.",https://c.pxhere.com/images/2b/a4/daf4066e3f99f40614b313e150c6-1620903.jpg!d,a stack of pancakes,,,

Having lived in the Sene-Gambia region (Senegal and Gambia) for 7 years, i know the real history of the dish. This dish originates from the Sene-Gambia region for centuries past, it is called Benachin which translates to ""One Pot"". All ingredients are cooked in a pot hence the name One Pot. Usually when cooking you do things simultaneously.

Broken rice is used (very small rice) and it has a very distinctive redish colour and a famous spice in that region caled ""Maggi"" is used to enhance the taste.
I'm Ghanaian so there's 0 bias in this.
And having tasted variants from west African countries, This remains the best and authentic. I rest my case.

The owners of the dish haven't said anything in defence, they are just watching the Ghana man and Nigerians fight for no fruitful reason",,,,,

Nutrient-Rich: Tabbouleh is packed with nutrients from its fresh ingredients. It contains vitamins A, C, and K from parsley and tomatoes, as well as minerals like iron, calcium, and potassium.
Low in Calories: Tabbouleh is relatively low in calories, especially considering its high nutrient content. It's a great option for those looking to maintain or lose weight while still enjoying a flavorful dish.
High in Fiber: The bulgur wheat used in tabbouleh is a good source of dietary fiber, which aids digestion, helps maintain bowel regularity, and can contribute to a feeling of fullness, promoting weight management.
Rich in Antioxidants: The fresh herbs and vegetables in tabbouleh, such as parsley, tomatoes, and mint, are rich in antioxidants. These compounds help protect the body from oxidative stress and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.
Heart-Healthy: Tabbouleh is made with heart-healthy ingredients like olive oil, which is rich in monounsaturated fats that can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.
Hydration: Tabbouleh's ingredients like tomatoes and cucumber have high water content, contributing to hydration, especially in hot weather.
Overall, tabbouleh is a nutritious and delicious dish that can be enjoyed as a side or main course, providing a range of health benefits for those who consume it regularly.",,,,,

It is a royal dish and a common meal during holidays, with variations that include chicken, beef, mushrooms in a groundnut stew, or smoked fish in a plain groundnut stew. Luwombo is a special dish prepared for significant occasions like traditional marriages, parties, festivities, and last funeral rites, often served to important guests in the Baganda culture. The cooking process involves tying the ingredients in banana leaves and steaming them, a method that imparts a unique taste to the dish. Luwombo is a symbol of respect for visitors and is used to honor special occasions, with its absence at a ceremony considered a minor event in Buganda culture. The dish is not only popular among the Baganda people but has also been adopted by other tribes in Uganda and is a common feature on the menus of many Ugandan hotels and restaurants. Luwombo is often accompanied by a drink called Waragi, a local gin, or Ajono, a beer made from millet.",,,,,
