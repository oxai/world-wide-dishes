## VQA Experiments to probe generated outputs for potential biases

We explore the use of state-of-the-art VQA models to identify food-related stereotypes by prompting the model with multiple-choice questions to identify visual elements that could reveal stereotyped generalisations within generated images. The VQA model processes each generated dish image along with its corresponding question and selects an answer from the given choices. We analyse the distribution of responses for dish images generated for different regions and plot the proportion of images with the same response to assess the severity of food stereotypes. We use [Llava-v1.6-34b](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-01-30-llava-next/) as the default VQA model due to its superior performance in initial experiments compared to other models. 

In the following instructions, we assume that you are running your code from the [`/vqa`](/vqa/) directory of the repository (`world-wide-dishes`).

To get started, create an experiment folder in [`/vqa/experiments`](/vqa/experiments/) to store the experiment-specific configurations and model outputs for each step below.

###  1. Create a `JSON file` containing a list of questions and choices. 
Create `JSON file` in the specified format below defining the list of questions to prompt the VQA model. We provide the example of  `questions.json` used in the experiment. 

 ```json

    "questions": [
        {

            "type": "multiple_choice",
            "correct_answer": null
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Create a `config.ini` file specifying the experiment configurations

In the experiments folder, create a file named `config.ini` to specify:

- **A path to the JSON file** containing the questions.
- **Path to a directory** containing the generated dishes. The images file paths are stored in a way that allows us to easily extract metadata specific to a dish image such as the model name, region, and dish name if applicable. Refer to the section on generating the images to see the file path formats supported.

An example of a `config.ini` used to run experiment is shown below. Modify it to suit the specific experiment you wish to run.

```ini
[dataset]
images_dir = /food-bias/countries_all

[questions] 
path = questions.json
```

### 3. Create VQA questions for each generated dish image

To create the questions for each generated dish image, run the script below specifying:

- **Path to the `./experiments` directory** created.
- **Path to the question file**: This file contains the initial set of questions to be used. You need to provide the full path to this JSON file.
- **Output file path**: This is the path where the generated questions will be saved in JSONL format.

The script to run is shown below. Replace the placeholders with the actual paths as needed:

```bash
python3 scripts/create_questions.py <experiments_directory> --question-file <path_to_question_file> --questions-output-file <output_file_path>
```

The script above will generate a JSONL file. Each entry in this file will contain:

- The path to a generated dish image.
- A question related to the image.
- A set of choices for the question.

### 4. Start a LLAVA model server instance
We use SGLang to create an instance of the [Llava-v1.6-34b](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-01-30-llava-next/) model as it supports quantization, multiple inferencing and parallel batching making it suitable to run on a single A100 80GB machine. You can set up [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) using the setup instructions provided [here](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang?tab=readme-ov-file#install).

Once you have SGLang setup, run the co below to start a model instance.

```bash
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-34b --tokenizer-path liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-34b-tokenizer --port 3000
```

### 5. Run the VQA questions

To prompt the VQA model instance with the questions, run the script below specifying:

- **Path to the question file**: The JSONL file containing the questions generated in the previous step.
- **Output file path**: The path where the VQA model's answers will be saved in JSONL format.
- **Port number**: The port number on which the LLAVA model server instance is running.

The script to run is shown below. Replace the placeholders with the actual paths and port number as needed:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_VQA_sg.py --question-file <path_to_question_file> --answer-file <output_file_path> --port <port_number>
```

### 6. VQA Analysis

Finally, to compare the VQA responses across the T2I models, we provide a detailed notebook: [`analysis.ipynb`](/vqa/notebooks/analysis.ipynb). This notebook:

- Loads the questions and answers JSONL files generated in the previous step.
- Plots the distribution of responses for each question across the different models.

Use this notebook to visualize and analyze the VQA model's performance and compare the results across different T2I models.
